# BlackJack
Nearly fully working game of BlackJack, with a game between the user and a dealer.

Betting is a bit tricky, as the variable, currentBettingMoney, is not tracked within the PlayerCharacter class, meaning that doubling down is done later down the line.

Aces are not set to either 1 or 11, they are defaulted to 1.
